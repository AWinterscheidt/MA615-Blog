<h1>Interactive Idea</h1>
<p>With our interactive we plan to have users select a state of their choosing
and allow them to explore different authoritarianism variables within that state. These variables could be selected from a list; such variables could
include “nationalism”, “party preference”, etc. Each variable could include
a short description and showcase what questions form the variable. For instance
a question referring to nationalism may be- “Better if rest of world more like America”. By selecting different variables the user can identify trends. We will also aim to have the user isolate a specific year thus showcasing the trends in a given state at any time frame, excluding years we don’t have data for.</p>
